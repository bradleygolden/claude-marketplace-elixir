# Review Marketplace Changes

You are conducting a **pre-push code review** for the Claude Code plugin marketplace. This review validates all staged/modified files before they are pushed to the remote branch.

## Your Role

You are a **critical quality gate** that ensures:
1. Changes follow marketplace patterns and conventions
2. Sub-agents are used appropriately in slash commands
3. Comments are critical and necessary (no fluff or obvious explanations)
4. Changes are technically correct and ready for production

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Identify Changed Files

1. Use Bash to run:
   ```bash
   git status --short && git diff --cached --name-only && git diff --name-only
   ```
2. Categorize changes by type:
   - Plugin files (plugin.json, hooks.json, scripts)
   - Slash commands (.claude/commands/*.md)
   - Sub-agent definitions (.claude/agents/*.md)
   - Tests (test/plugins/**)
   - Documentation (README.md, *.md)
   - Marketplace metadata (marketplace.json)

### Phase 2: Parallel Analysis & Cleanup

Spawn FOUR parallel sub-agent tasks using the Task tool in a single response block:

**Task 1: Plugin/Hook Changes Analysis**
Use Task tool with `subagent_type="analyzer"`:
- For each changed plugin.json, hooks.json, or script file:
  - Trace execution flow to ensure correctness
  - Verify hook matchers and patterns
  - Check for blocking vs non-blocking behavior consistency
  - Validate error handling and output formats
  - Compare with working marketplace patterns

**Task 2: Command/Agent Review**
Use Task tool with `subagent_type="finder"`:
- For each changed .claude/commands/*.md or .claude/agents/*.md:
  - Verify sub-agent usage is appropriate:
    - Are Task calls used for parallelization?
    - Is finder used for pattern finding?
    - Is analyzer used for execution tracing?
  - Check if command follows marketplace patterns
  - Validate output structure and formatting
  - Ensure TodoWrite is used for progress tracking

**Task 3: Comment Cleanup**
Use Task tool with `subagent_type="comment-cleaner"`:
- Find all files with comments in the changeset
- For EACH file with comments:
  - Read the entire file for context
  - Evaluate every comment individually
  - Remove unnecessary comments (obvious, redundant)
  - Keep critical comments (algorithms, non-obvious behavior, security, performance, integration)
  - Document all decisions (why removed/kept)
- Automatically clean up files by removing unnecessary comments
- Provide detailed report of all actions taken

**Task 4: Version Management Validation**
Use Task tool with `subagent_type="analyzer"`:
- Compare current branch with main branch to determine what actually changed
- Check version consistency:
  - If marketplace.json changed: marketplace version MUST be bumped
  - If plugin files changed: that specific plugin version MUST be bumped
  - If plugin A changed, plugin B version should NOT be bumped
  - All version bumps must be relative to main branch, not previous commits on current branch
- Validate version format (semver: X.Y.Z or X.Y.Z-rc.N)
- Check for version mismatches between related files
- Compare with main branch: `git diff main -- .claude-plugin/marketplace.json plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

Wait for ALL four agents to complete before proceeding.

### Phase 3: Best Practices Validation

After Phase 2 agents complete, validate changed files against Claude Code best practices.

**Step 1: Identify Files by Type**

Based on changed files from Phase 1, determine which validators to run:

- **Commands**: `.claude/commands/*.md` files
- **Agents**: `.claude/agents/*.md` files
- **Hooks**: `plugins/*/hooks/*.json` files
- **Scripts**: `plugins/*/scripts/*.sh` files
- **Docs**: `README.md`, `plugins/*/README.md`, `test/plugins/*/README.md` files

**Step 2: Spawn Validators in Parallel**

Spawn Task agents in parallel (single response, multiple Task calls) for each file type that has changes.
Use Task tool with `subagent_type="Explore"` for all validators:

**Task: Command Validator** (if `.claude/commands/*.md` changed)
```
Validate the following slash command files against Claude Code best practices:

2. Execution flow error in file.ext:line - MUST FIX
3. Best practices critical violation in file.ext:line - MUST FIX

### Phase 5: Write Review Document

After synthesizing the review report, save it to the `.thoughts/` directory for future reference.

1. **Generate review metadata:**
   ```bash
   git config user.name
   git rev-parse HEAD
   git branch --show-current
   git remote get-url origin | sed 's/.*[:/]\([^/]*\/[^/]*\)\.git/\1/'
   date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
   date +"%Y-%m-%d"
   ```

2. **Create review document filename:**
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-marketplace-review.md`
   - Example: `2025-10-23-marketplace-review.md`
   - If file exists, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

3. **Structure review document with YAML frontmatter:**
   ```markdown
   ---
   date: [Current date and time in ISO format]
   reviewer: [Git user name]
   git_commit: [Current commit hash]
   branch: [Current branch name]
   repository: [Repository name from git remote]
   review_type: pre-push
   overall_status: [READY_TO_PUSH | NEEDS_WORK | DO_NOT_PUSH]
   critical_issues: [Count]

   # Marketplace Pre-Push Code Review

   **Date**: [Current date and time]
   **Reviewer**: [Git user name]
   **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash]
   **Branch**: [Current branch name]
   **Repository**: [Repository name]

   ## Executive Summary

   - **Total files changed**: X
   - **Critical issues**: X ❌
   - **Warnings**: X ⚠️
   - **Recommendations**: X 💡
   - **Best practices violations**: X ❌ critical, X ⚠️ warnings, X 💡 recommendations
   - **Overall Assessment**: ✅ READY TO PUSH / ⚠️ NEEDS WORK / ❌ DO NOT PUSH

   [Full review content from Phase 4 - all sections 1-10]
   ```

4. **Write the review document:**
   - Use Write tool to create `.thoughts/YYYY-MM-DD-marketplace-review.md`
   - Include complete review with all sections from Phase 3
   - Ensure all file references include line numbers
   - Include complete agent reports (comment cleanup, version validation)

5. **Present concise summary to user:**
   - Show overall assessment (✅/⚠️/❌)
   - List critical issues if any
   - Show path to saved review document
   - Provide next steps based on assessment

### Phase 6: Generate Changelog (Optional)

After writing the review document, generate changelog entries for the branch changes.

**Only run this phase if the overall status is ✅ READY TO PUSH or ⚠️ NEEDS WORK** (skip if ❌ DO NOT PUSH with critical issues).

1. **Spawn changelog-curator subagent:**

Use Task tool with `subagent_type="changelog-curator"`:

```
Analyze the current branch vs main and generate changelog entries.

Your task:
1. Compare current branch against main to identify all changes
2. Classify changes semantically (breaking/features/fixes/improvements)
3. Generate Keep a Changelog format entries
4. Recommend semantic version bump (major/minor/patch)
5. Verify version files match recommendation

Provide your report with:
- Change analysis summary
- Semantic version recommendation with reasoning
- Changelog draft in Keep a Changelog format
- List of files requiring version updates

Branch: $(git branch --show-current)
Current versions:
- Marketplace: $(jq -r '.metadata.version' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json)
- Core plugin: $(jq -r '.version' plugins/core/.claude-plugin/plugin.json 2>/dev/null || echo "N/A")
- Credo plugin: $(jq -r '.version' plugins/credo/.claude-plugin/plugin.json 2>/dev/null || echo "N/A")
```

2. **Wait for changelog-curator to complete**

3. **Save changelog draft:**
   - Generate filename: `.thoughts/CHANGELOG-draft-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
   - If file exists, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.
   - Write the changelog draft from the curator's report
   - Use Write tool to create the file

4. **Include in review summary:**
   - Add changelog location to the concise summary presented to user
   - Show recommended version bump
   - Note if version files need updates

**Output additions to summary:**

```markdown
### Changelog

**Recommended version**: X.Y.Z (bump type: major/minor/patch)
**Changelog draft**: .thoughts/CHANGELOG-draft-YYYY-MM-DD.md

[If version files need updates]
⚠️ Version files need updating:
- .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
- plugins/<plugin-name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

[If versions are already correct]
✅ Version files are already correct
```

## Critical Validation Rules

### Sub-Agent Usage (for .claude/commands/*.md files)
- ✅ Use Task tool for parallel work (research, analysis)
- ✅ Use finder for "find patterns" or "show examples"
- ✅ use analyzer for "trace execution" or "analyze implementation"
- ✅ Spawn multiple agents in single response block for parallelization
- ❌ Don't use sub-agents for simple file reads
- ❌ Don't spawn agents when direct tools (Grep, Read) are faster

### Comment Quality
- ✅ Keep: Complex algorithm explanations
- ✅ Keep: Non-obvious behavior rationale
- ✅ Keep: Security/performance trade-offs
- ❌ Remove: Obvious explanations
- ❌ Remove: Redundant docstrings
- ❌ Remove: TODO comments (convert to issues)
- ❌ Remove: Commented-out code

### Version Management
- ✅ Compare versions against main branch, not current branch history
- ✅ If marketplace.json changed: marketplace version MUST be bumped
- ✅ If plugin files changed: that specific plugin version MUST be bumped
- ✅ If plugin A changed, plugin B version should NOT be bumped (unless also changed)
- ✅ Version format must be valid semver: X.Y.Z or X.Y.Z-rc.N
- ❌ Don't bump versions based on commits within current branch
- ❌ Don't bump all plugin versions when only one changed

### Marketplace Patterns
- ✅ JSON files are valid (check with jq)
- ✅ Hooks follow matcher patterns (Edit|Write, Bash, etc.)
- ✅ Scripts are executable and have proper shebangs
- ✅ File paths use {{file_path}} template variables
- ✅ Blocking hooks exit 2 on stderr, non-blocking use additionalContext
- ✅ Plugins registered in marketplace.json
- ✅ Tests exist in test/plugins/<plugin-name>/

## Output Requirements

- **Be thorough but concise** - focus on issues, not perfect code
- **Use file:line references** for every issue/example
- **Be non-judgmental** - compare with patterns, don't critique style
- **Provide context** - show marketplace examples for comparison
- **Give clear guidance** - user should know exactly what to do next
- **Use severity indicators** consistently:
  - ❌ Critical (blocks push)
  - ⚠️ Warning (should fix but not blocking)
  - 💡 Recommendation (nice to have)

## Progress Tracking

Use TodoWrite throughout to track:
1. Identifying changed files
2. Spawning four parallel agents (analyzer, finder, comment-cleaner, version validator)
3. Waiting for all agent results
4. Spawning best practices validators (based on changed file types)
5. Waiting for validator results
6. Synthesizing review report (includes all analysis, cleanup, and validation)
7. Writing review document to .thoughts/ directory
8. Generating changelog (if status allows)
9. Presenting concise summary to user

## Important Notes

- This is a **quality gate**, not a refactoring session
- Focus on **correctness** and **patterns**, not style preferences
- **Do not suggest fixes** unless they're obvious from marketplace patterns
- **Do not rewrite code** - only identify issues
- Remember: comments should explain **WHY**, not **WHAT**
- The **comment-cleaner agent** will automatically remove unnecessary comments during review
- The **version validator** ensures versions are bumped correctly relative to main branch
- The **best practices validators** check all changed files against Claude Code standards
- The **changelog-curator agent** generates semantic changelog entries based on branch changes
- **Critical best practices violations BLOCK the push** - treat them as seriously as other critical issues
- **Review documents are saved** to `.thoughts/` directory for future reference
- **Changelog drafts are saved** to `.thoughts/` directory for easy editing before release
- Present a **concise summary** to the user; full details are in the saved review document
- The user will push if you give ✅ READY TO PUSH - be thorough!
- Overall status logic: ❌ DO NOT PUSH if (critical_issues > 0 OR bp_critical > 0)
