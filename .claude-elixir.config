# .claude-elixir.config
# Configuration for Elixir plugins in Claude Code
#
# This file controls behavior of Elixir plugins including hooks, skills, and agents.
# Currently supports: ignore patterns for pre-commit hooks
# Future: Will support [sections] for advanced configuration

# Ignore patterns (one per line, supports glob patterns)
# Hooks will skip validation for projects matching these patterns

# Test fixture directories (contain intentional errors for testing)
