# Workflow Generator Skill

This skill generates a complete set of project-specific workflow commands by asking questions about your project and creating customized `/research`, `/plan`, `/implement`, and `/qa` commands.

## Purpose

Create a standardized workflow system adapted to any project's:
- Tech stack and language
- Build/test commands
- Documentation structure
- Quality gates and validation criteria
- Planning methodology

## Template System

### Template Path Resolution

Templates are stored in `plugins/meta/skills/workflow-generator/templates/`. When this skill uses the Read tool:
- **During marketplace development**: Paths are relative to repository root
- **When plugin is installed**: Claude Code resolves paths relative to plugin installation location
- Template paths in this skill use the format: `plugins/meta/skills/workflow-generator/templates/<template-name>.md`

### Template Syntax

Templates use two types of variable substitution:

**1. Simple Variable Substitution**
Replace `{{VARIABLE}}` with actual values:
```
{{PROJECT_TYPE}} → "Phoenix Application"
{{DOCS_LOCATION}} → ".thoughts"
{{TEST_COMMAND}} → "mix test"
```

**2. Handlebars Conditionals** (in some templates)
Templates may use Handlebars syntax for conditional content:
```
{{#if PLANNING_STYLE equals "Detailed phases"}}
  Phase-based content
{{/if}}

{{#if PLANNING_STYLE equals "Task checklist"}}
  Checklist-based content
{{/if}}
```

**How to handle Handlebars syntax:**
- Handlebars conditionals are preserved in generated commands (not substituted)
- The generated command will contain the conditional logic
- Claude will evaluate conditionals when the command is executed
- This allows generated commands to adapt behavior based on context

## Execution Flow

When invoked, this skill will:

1. **Discover Project Context**
2. **Ask Customization Questions**
3. **Generate Workflow Commands**
4. **Create Supporting Documentation**
5. **Provide Usage Instructions**

---

## Step 1: Discover Project Context

### 1.1 Detect Project Type

Analyze the current directory to understand the project:

```bash
# Check for common project markers
ls package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "nodejs"
ls mix.exs 2>/dev/null && echo "elixir"
ls Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null && echo "rust"
ls go.mod 2>/dev/null && echo "go"
ls setup.py pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null && echo "python"
ls pom.xml build.gradle 2>/dev/null && echo "java"
```

### 1.2 Check Existing Structure

```bash
# Check for existing .claude directory
ls .claude/commands/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls .claude/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

### 1.3 Detect Build Tools

Look for common build/test patterns:
- Makefile with test target
- package.json with scripts
- mix.exs with test tasks
- Cargo.toml
- go.mod

---

## Step 2: Ask Customization Questions

Use TodoWrite to track progress:
```
1. [in_progress] Discover project context
2. [pending] Ask customization questions
3. [pending] Generate /research command
4. [pending] Generate /plan command
5. [pending] Generate /implement command
6. [pending] Generate /qa command
7. [pending] Generate /oneshot command
8. [pending] Generate /interview command
9. [pending] Create documentation
10. [pending] Present usage instructions
```

- "WORKFLOWS.md" → `WORKFLOWS.md`
- "docs/WORKFLOWS.md" → `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`
- "README-WORKFLOWS.md" → `README-WORKFLOWS.md`

If the answer is "docs/WORKFLOWS.md", create the docs directory first:
```bash
mkdir -p docs
```

**Content** for the WORKFLOWS.md file:

```markdown
# Elixir Project Workflows

## Configuration Summary

**Project**: {{PROJECT_TYPE}} (Elixir)

**Commands Configured**:
- Compile: `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`
- Test: `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`
- Format: `mix format --check-formatted`

**Quality Tools Enabled**:

**Planning Style**: {{PLANNING_STYLE}}

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Research the Codebase

```bash
/research "How does [feature] work?"
```

This will:
- Spawn parallel research agents
- Document findings with file:line references
- Save to `{{DOCS_LOCATION}}/research-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

### 2. Create an Implementation Plan

```bash
/plan "Add new feature X"
```

This will:
- Gather context via research
- Present design options
- Create phased plan with success criteria
- Save to `{{DOCS_LOCATION}}/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-x.md`

### 3. Execute the Plan

```bash
/implement "2025-01-23-feature-x"
```

This will:
- Read the plan
- Execute phase by phase
- Run verification after each phase (`mix compile`, {{TEST_COMMAND}})
- Update checkmarks
- Pause for confirmation

### 4. Validate Implementation

```bash
/qa "feature-x"
```

This will:
- Run all quality gate checks
- Generate validation report
- Provide actionable feedback

---

## Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Adding a new Phoenix context

```bash
# 1. Research existing patterns
/research "How are contexts structured in this Phoenix app?"

# 2. Create implementation plan
/plan "Add Accounts context with user management"

# 3. Execute the plan
/implement "2025-01-23-accounts-context"

# 4. Validate implementation
/qa "accounts-context"
```

---

## Customization

All generated commands are fully editable. Customize them to match your exact workflow:

- **Add custom validation**: Edit `.claude/commands/qa.md`
- **Change plan structure**: Edit `.claude/commands/plan.md`
- **Add research sources**: Edit `.claude/commands/research.md`
- **Modify checkpoints**: Edit `.claude/commands/implement.md`

---

## Re-generate Commands

To regenerate these commands with different settings:

```bash
/workflow-generator
```

This will ask questions again and regenerate all commands.

---

## Documentation

Full workflow documentation: `{{WORKFLOWS_MD_LOCATION}}`

**Note**: Show the actual file path where WORKFLOWS.md was created.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Try your first research: `/research "project structure"`
2. Read workflow docs: `{{WORKFLOWS_MD_LOCATION}}`
3. Customize commands as needed (edit `.claude/commands/*.md`)
4. Start your first planned feature!

**Note**: Replace `{{WORKFLOWS_MD_LOCATION}}` with the actual file path.

**Need help?** Each command has detailed instructions in its markdown file.
```

Mark step 10 completed in TodoWrite.

Mark all todos as completed and present final summary to user.

---

## Important Notes

### Generic Core Components

The generated commands maintain these universal patterns:
- TodoWrite for progress tracking
- Parallel agent spawning (finder, analyzer)
- YAML frontmatter with git metadata
- file:line reference format
- Documentation vs evaluation separation
- Success criteria framework (automated vs manual)

### Elixir-Specific Customizations

Commands are customized based on:
- Elixir project type (Phoenix, Library, CLI, Umbrella)
- Test commands (mix test, make test, custom)
- Documentation location preferences
- Quality tools enabled (Credo, Dialyzer, Sobelow, etc.)
- Planning methodology

### Extensibility

All generated commands are templates that users can:
- Edit directly to add project-specific logic
- Extend with additional validation
- Modify to match team conventions
- Enhance with custom agent types

### Agent Types Referenced

Generated commands use these standard agents:
- `finder`: Locate files and patterns
- `analyzer`: Deep technical analysis
- `general-purpose`: Flexible research tasks

Projects can define custom agents in `.claude/agents/` for specialized behavior.

---

## Error Handling

If generation fails at any step:
1. Report which step failed
2. Show the error
3. Offer to retry just that step
4. Provide manual instructions if needed

---

## Validation

After generating all commands:
1. Check that all files were created
2. Validate markdown structure
3. Verify template variables were replaced
4. Confirm documentation directory exists
5. Present final status to user
